The Memory Match Game is an interactive and engaging web-based game that tests players' memory and concentration skills. Players start by selecting a category, such as Fruits, Emojis, Animals, or Planets. The game then generates a grid of face-down cards, each containing a hidden symbol. The objective is to find and match pairs of identical symbols by flipping two cards at a time. If the selected cards match, they remain visible; otherwise, they flip back over. The game is time-bound, adding an element of challenge. When the time runs out, a popup displays the final score and provides options to either restart the game or return to the home screen. With an intuitive user interface and dynamic gameplay, this game is a fun and simple way to improve memory skills while enjoying visually appealing graphics.
